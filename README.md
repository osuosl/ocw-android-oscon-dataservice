# OCW Android OSCON Data Service

Datafeed service written in Django for
[Openconferenceware-android](https://github.com/osuosl/ocw-android) which
scrapes the OSCON site and presents the proper JSON format for the android app.

**NOTE: This app has little to no documentation and was last tested in 2010. It
likely does not work anymore**
